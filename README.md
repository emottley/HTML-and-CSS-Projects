# HTML & CSS Projects
 
This is a collection of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS while learning.

## Space Station Site
This page is an example homepage for a Space Travel Company. It is styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image container, and a form.
  
## Make Music Site
This page is similar to the Space Center Site, but includes an embedded Youtube video. It also uses more styling techniques in CSS.
  
## Movie Theater Site
This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
  
## Portfolio Site
This page is my portfolio site. It is the only website that is live at https://emottley.github.io/. This site has a form that is connected to an API, has animations and media queries at the current moment. This page will continue to be developed as I add more programming languages to it.
